<h1>Simple web servers and udp servers</h1>
This directory contains 3 small web server examples.
<pre>
basic_web_server.c
test_OKworks.c  
test_readSiliconRev.c
</pre>

The test_readSiliconRev.c implemens a web server and a UDP sever.
<br>
<h2>Configuration of the IP address</h2>
You will have to change the IP address that the web server gets before you
compile this code. 
Change the following line in file main.c and assign an IP address that is compatible
with the address range in your local network (e.g if your PC has the address 192.168.0.8
then try to give this board the address 192.168.0.9).
<br>
<pre>
static uint8_t myip[4] = {10,0,0,29}; // this would be http://10.0.0.29 in your web browser
</pre>

<h2>Compiling and loading the code into the tuxgraphics ethernet board</h2>
Please see the <a href="../README.htm">top level README.htm file</a> for
details.
<h2>Using the UDP interface</h2>
To use the udp interface you can use a tool called udpcom which comes with this package.
Versions are available for Linux, windows, and Mac.

<br>
<br>
The udpcom utility sends text based commands in form of short UDP messages
to the UDP server running on the ethernet board.
<br>
<pre>
The test_readSiliconRev.c (compiles to load_readSiliconRev.hex) reads 
the enc28j60 silicon revision and displays it. 
You can use it as a base for a simple application
where you want to just read data (e.g thermometer)

The command that you can send via udpcom is called "ver"

Example:

udpcom ver 10.0.0.29

will answer:
II: data: ver, ip: 10.0.0.29 port: 1200
OK: 10.0.0.29: ver=B4


This means the ENC28J60 silicon rev is B4
