<h1>Sending email notifications from the tuxgraphics ethernet board</h1>
Almost all email service providers have started to block mail servers which do not have a proper DNS PTR record or origin from network addresses that are not meant to be used as
mailservers. Many ISPs that care about their networks block for this reason direct SMTP (=email) services from DSL customers in the firewall. To send an email directly from your home DSL line is therefore not an option. 
<br>
<br>
The email has to be sent via an official mail server.
<h2>How it works</h2>
The web client on the ethernet board does a http request towards the
tuxgraphics.org server. This server checks if you have a valid account
and then converts the information from the http request into an email.
<br>
<br>
You can order a tuxgraphics microcontroller mail account at 
<a href=http://shop.tuxgraphics.org/mm.html>http://shop.tuxgraphics.org/mm.html</a>
<br>
<br>
 You can administrate your mail account at <a href=http://tuxgraphics.org/cgi-bin/mm>http://tuxgraphics.org/cgi-bin/mm</a>

<h2>Using test_emailnotify to receive email notifications</h2>
To use this software you need to:
<pre>
1) order a microcontroller email account at http://shop.tuxgraphics.org/mm.html

2) edit test_emailnotify.c and search for the string gus123. Replace
this string by the microcontroller email account ID that you received.
Edit also the IP addresses as described at the beginning of this file.

3) run make to compile the software

4) load the test_emailnotify.hex into the microccontroller

5) Connect PD6 with GND for a moment and ... you will get an email sent to
the email address specified in your tuxgraphics microcontroller email account.
The destination email address is specified in the email account
and not in the test_emailnotify software to prevent SPAM and abuse.

6) Point your web browser to the IP address you gave the board (myip, e.g 
http://10.0.0.29). The board runs not only a web client but as
well a web server where it will show you some information about
the status of the email sending process.

<h2>The LED on pin PB1</h2>
A diagnostic LED can be connected between pin PB1 and Vcc:
<ul>
<li>The LED goes on the moment the web client tries to connect to the
internet and goes off after a successful connection.
<li>The LED starts to blink in 1sec intervals if the tuxgraphics microcontroller
mail account has expired
</ul>

<h2>Configuration of the IP address</h2>
You will have to change the IP address that the client (server) gets before you
compile this code. 
Change the following line in file main.c and assign an IP address that is compatible
with the address range in your local network.
<br>
<pre>
static uint8_t myip[4] = {10,0,0,29}; 
</pre>

<br>
In order to get out onto the internet the web client needs to know
the IP address of the gateway behind which it can find the host
that it wants to contact. This is normally the internal IP address
of your DSL router.
<br>
<pre>
static uint8_t gwip[4] = {10,0,0,2};
</pre>

<h2>Compiling and loading the code into the tuxgraphics ethernet board</h2>
