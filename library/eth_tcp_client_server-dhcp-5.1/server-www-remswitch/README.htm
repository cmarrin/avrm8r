<h1>Ethernet remote switch (aka web switch)</h1>
This is an example for a web server that can control a relay connected via pin PD7. The web server
provides a web page from where you can switch the relay on or off.
There is as well the possibility to control the relay via UDP messages.
<br>
<br>
Between pin PD6 and GND you can optionally attach a push button to manually switch the relay on/off.
<h2>Configuration of the IP address and password</h2>
You will have to change the IP address that the web server gets before you
compile this code. 
Change the following line in file main.c and assign an IP address that is compatible
with the address range in your local network (e.g if your PC has the address 192.168.0.8
then try to give this board the address 192.168.0.9).
<br>
<pre>
static uint8_t myip[4] = {10,0,0,29}; // this would be http://10.0.0.29 in your web browser
</pre>
The password is defined by the following line
<pre>
// the password string (only a-z,0-9,_ characters):
static char password[]="secret"; 
</pre>
The software is written such that the
password becomes part of the URL which makes it
easy to bookmark a URL e.g on your phone. Like this: http://10.0.0.29/secret/


<h2>Compiling and loading the code into the tuxgraphics ethernet board</h2>
Please see the <a href="../README.htm">top level README.htm file</a> for
details.
<h2>Using the UDP interface</h2>
To use the udp interface you can use a tool called <a href="../udpcom/">udpcom</a> which comes with this package.
Versions are available for Linux, windows, and Mac.

<br>
<br>
The udpcom utility sends text based commands in form of short UDP messages
to the UDP server running on the ethernet board.
<br>
The only supported useful function  is to switch on or
of the transistor connected to PD7.
<pre>
The command to switch on is: t=1
The command to switch off is: t=0
Query the status: t=?

The udpcom syntax is: udpcom password,X=Y IP-addr

Here is an example:
./udpcom/unix/udpcom secret,t=0 10.0.0.29
II: data: secret,t=0, ip: 10.0.0.29 port: 1200
OK: 10.0.0.29: t=0

./udpcom/unix/udpcom secret,t=1 10.0.0.29
II: data: secret,t=1, ip: 10.0.0.29 port: 1200
OK: 10.0.0.29: t=1

./udpcom/unix/udpcom secret,t=? 10.0.0.29
II: data: secret,t=?, ip: 10.0.0.29 port: 1200
OK: 10.0.0.29: t=1

./udpcom/unix/udpcom secret,t=0 10.0.0.29
II: data: secret,t=0, ip: 10.0.0.29 port: 1200
OK: 10.0.0.29: t=0

./udpcom/unix/udpcom secret,t=? 10.0.0.29
II: data: secret,t=?, ip: 10.0.0.29 port: 1200
OK: 10.0.0.29: t=0
