<h1>Simple web clients using DNS to find a server on the internet</h1>
This directory contains 3 small web clients. Each of them
upload data to a server on the internet and they use the dnslkup.c code
to look up the IP address of the server that they contact.
<br>
<br>
All of the examples implement as well a web server on the ethernet board such that you can point
a web browser on your PC to those and on the web pages that they
show you can see details about the status of the web client.
<pre>
test_web_client.c -- this is a web client that monitors ping requests
that it gets and if it detected a ping then it will upload information
as to where that ping came from to the web site 
http://tuxgraphics.org/cgi-bin/upld

To use this edit test_web_client.c and configure the IP addresses
as described below then load the code with
make load_test_web_client

send a single ping to the board e.g:
ping 10.0.0.29
(stop ping with crtl-c)

Point your web browser to <a href=http://tuxgraphics.org/cgi-bin/upld>http://tuxgraphics.org/cgi-bin/upld</a>. The site filters data by originating IP.
The originating is the external address of the DSL router were the
web client is connected. If you use the same router to get onto the internet
the the IP address suggested is already the correct one. Just click "show".
<br>
<br>
Instead of http://tuxgraphics.org/cgi-bin/upld 
can use the sdat cgi-script provided in <a href="../cgi-bin">the ../cgi-script directory</a>,
install it on your own web server and up-load data to your web server. Just replace in the C-code
the WEBSERVER_VHOST with the name of your own server and search for upld and replace it by sdat.
<br>
<br>

The board runs besides the web client as well a web server where you
can see debug and status information. You can open it in web browser
e.g http://10.0.0.29 (or whatever you configured as myip[4]).
</pre>

<pre>
test_identi_ca.c  -- post a message on identi.ca. To trigger the sending 
of the message connect PD6 to GND. You need a identi.ca account to use this. 
There is a timeout of 3min to prevent too many posts.

To use this edit test_web_client.c and configure the IP addresses
as described below then encode your identi.ca account username and 
password as described further down and load the code with

make load_test_identi_ca
</pre>

We used to have as well a twitter.com example code but twitter changed
their authentication method a while back such that the code would no longer
work. Apparently there was nobody using twitter from the ethernet board
and this code is now removed.

<h2>Configuration of the IP address</h2>
You will have to change the IP address that the client (server) gets before you
compile this code. 
Change the following line in file main.c and assign an IP address that is compatible
with the address range in your local network.
<br>
<pre>
static uint8_t myip[4] = {10,0,0,29}; 
</pre>

<br>
In order to get out onto the internet the web client needs to know
the IP address of the gateway behind which it can find the host
that it wants to contact. This is normally the internal IP address
of your DSL router.
<br>
<pre>
static uint8_t gwip[4] = {10,0,0,2};
</pre>
There is a special case when the server were you would like to
upload data to is on the same LAN as the web client. In that you
don't really have a gateway and then you have to set the gwip to
the IP address of the server that you want to upload to.

<h2>Configuration identi.ca account</h2>
The program test_identi_ca.c  uses a define
statement called BLOGGACCOUNT. This needs to contain an
base64 encoded string of your identi.ca account.
The user name and password need to be separated by a single colon (user:passw).
There is a web based tool to generate the BLOGGACCOUNT authorisation
code at <a href=http://tuxgraphics.org/~guido/javascript/base64-javascript.html>http://tuxgraphics.org/~guido/javascript/base64-javascript.html</a>.
<br>
This base64-javascript encoder can also be found in the subdirectory <a href=../files/>&quot;files&quot;</a>.

<br>
<br>
In this encoder enter username and password seperated by a single colon 
(username:youpassword) use the generated value in the "#define BLOGGACCOUNT":
<br>
<br>
#define BLOGGACCOUNT "Authorization: Basic ZABcdefghijklmnop12345=="
<br>
<br>
The sending of messages to twitter/identi.ca is triggered by  connecting PD6 to GND.

<h2>Compiling and loading the code into the tuxgraphics ethernet board</h2>
Please see the <a href="../README.htm">top level README.htm file</a> for
details.
