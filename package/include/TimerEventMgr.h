//  Class: TimerEventMgr
//
// Manage events which fire at given intervals. The timer needs to be
// about 1ms so system clients can give interval counts that will give
// approximately the desired timeout. For instance the Button debounce
// timer needs to have sufficient time to get accurate button values.
// The prescale value is given to the timer and the compareCount is computed
// from that and F_CPU. If the prescale value is insufficient to do a 1ms
// timeout with the given timer, the closest approximation is used. For
// instance, if an 8 bit timer is used and a prescale value of 1 is
// selected with an 8MHz clock, a 30us would be the result. This is
// probably a bad thing if you're using the Button or Network components.
// But selecting a prescale of 64 the 8 bit timer can use a compareCount
// of 125 to achieve a 1ms timeout. A compareCount can be provided to
// override this behavior, as long as the consequences are known.
